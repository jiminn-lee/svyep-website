For many high schoolers, mapping their career direction at an early age can seem like going down an unfamiliar path. In an interview with SVYEP, Erica Poon Werkun, now Director of Research for Asia Pacific at Citi and board member of the Wharton School’s Executive Board for Asia, revealed her own career was shaped by humility, mentorship, and her perseverance through challenges.

Erica’s path from research analyst at Goldman Sachs to leading research teams across Asia for global institutions like UBS, Credit Suisse, and Citi highlights her professional milestones and career success. More importantly, her success is a reflection of Erica’s character and understanding of how to make the most out of every opportunity presented.

After graduating and starting her professional career, Erica soon learned her education had prepared her only up to a point. “After spending years studying, I should be able to do whatever required of me for the job. However, that was not the reality. I think we have to just understand that education [...] may not fully prepare you for what’s ahead.” Desiring to succeed early on in the workplace, Erica realized the best way to learn was to ask questions. “There are no silly questions. It is better to ask the question than not ask and make assumptions.” By asking thoughtful questions, Erica learned insights that not only expanded her skillset, but allowed her to learn from more experienced individuals.

Erica’s commitment to growth through learning from others became especially evident a few years into her career. On her first day working under a renowned technology investment banker in Silicon Valley, she was eager but uncertain of what to expect. While sitting at her desk, an executive banker approached and greeted her, but it wasn’t just a polite introduction. It was one of respect, showing by his awareness of her background. “[...] I was very starstruck, first of all, and then I was just very impressed [that] he had taken the time to know who I am. [...] that first impression really stayed with me and shaped what type of leader I wanted myself to be.” Learning from mentors and role models, Erica found every opportunity to take lessons from their leadership styles and incorporate them into her own. She came to realize that leadership isn’t defined by a title, but by the ability to recognize the worth in others at every stage of their journey.

That early moment of recognition became a blueprint of how she would later lead teams of her own. Once Erica began managing others, she applauded team members who sought to do more, members who sought to seize opportunities when they appeared. That moment changed her outlook on leadership, inspiring her to stay connected with her teams, mentor new members, and help others grow in their careers just as she once was helped.

When asked about what she might have done differently, Erica noted she never had any regrets. “I tend to always make informed decisions based on all the available information. Because things continue to evolve,” she explained. Evaluating every perspective before making a choice, she chooses to focus on what she can control. Even when a decision doesn’t produce the best result, she believes that in the moment it was the right one. However, Erica wishes she could have spent more time developing other skills. “I wish I spent more time learning different languages. I wish I had read more books. [...] Cryptocurrency, AI infrastructure, a lot of these [topics] are what’s going to continue to drive the future in our industry, but certainly [it’s] something I didn’t get to learn when I was in school more than 30 years ago.”

Today, Erica believes students should focus more on developing their soft skills than hard ones.She acknowledges that hard skills are fundamental, stating, “For entry level, someone who is newer to the industry, the focus is probably more on the hard skill. [...] those are always building blocks.”; however she has always been more keen on soft skills. “How hungry you are, how passionate you are, and most importantly, [are you] an ethical person?”

Erica’s advice to students? “Know there will be setbacks. Just know there will be a ton along the way. My advice [...], always be curious, always give it 120% effort because opportunities will come.” Explaining how she balances work and personal priorities, Erica states that family life and maintaining friendships outside of work keep her grounded. “We’ve got to be healthy, both physically and mentally, to tackle a lot of things in our lives.”

Erica demonstrates that true success is not only centered around skills and ambition, but deeply rooted in one’s perseverance and purpose. Through her story, she hopes to inspire students to carry forward the mindset of curiosity and resilience, and push through challenges with the same determination that shaped her path. Starting from a young analyst to becoming a global research director, Erica’s story is a reminder that leadership isn’t about titles, but about leading with respect and listening to others. She continues to live by that philosophy today, encouraging students to do the same.

As Erica once stated, “You may or may not go to your dream school, get your dream internship, or secure your dream full-time job. But whatever path you take, give it 120% effort in everything you do because opportunities will come.”
