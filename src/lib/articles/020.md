While SVYEP managed the operations and logistics, planning tirelessly to ensure the event was a success, we wanted to go even further. SVYEP hosted our own section within the summit, the Innovations Pitch Event.

SVYEP selected 15 student-run businesses and offered them the chance to pitch in front of a panel of investors and judges. To kick off the morning, an informative workshop, “Mastering Your VC Pitch: From Vision to Value,” led by professors from Stanford University, shared insights into crafting a winning venture capital pitch based on personal experiences.

In the afternoon, the pitch event provided a platform for the young entrepreneurs to showcase their innovations and ideas. Each participant was given the opportunity to present their business and highlight their impact. The judges evaluated the pitches, offering valuable feedback to the contestants to refine their ventures and what to do looking forward.

The afternoon pitch event provided a platform for young entrepreneurs to showcase their innovations and ideas in front of a panel of investors, startup mentors, and industry leaders. Each participant had a set time limit to present their concept, outline their strategy, and highlight their impact. The judges evaluated the pitches based on not only the product but also the pitch, offering valuable feedback to the contestants to refine their ventures.

SVYEP’s breakout room within the Global AI Pitch Summit served as a stepping stone for gaining mentorship and funding. Combining creativity, innovation, and ambition to highlight the next generation of entrepreneurs, this event reinforced SVYEP’s mission to empower students through business and leadership.

Once finishing up the competition, students and SVYEP leaders returned back to the summit’s main area where they were able to continue networking and learning from the business leaders around them.
