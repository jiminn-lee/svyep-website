This past weekend, our SVYEP team participated in the Leadways School Christmas Market Winter Festival. Meeting with young students and their families from around the Bay Area, we explained our mission of offering students professional experience and connecting them to entrepreneurs. Explaining the benefits we provide students with, we received huge interest from families. With our Youth Entrepreneurship Program (YEP) launching soon, families learned how the program could help their children gain entrepreneurial exposure at a young age while exploring their creativity.

Launching in winter of 2025, SVYEP is hosting a Youth Entrepreneurship Program (YEP) for young kids from grades 4-6. Throughout the span of 8 weeks, students will design a product, service, or business revolving around a cartoon character of their choice. They will learn how to design, promote, market, and financially manage their creative innovation. This will allow for young students to be introduced to a new field of study at a young age, broadening their scope by exploring areas like product design, marketing, promotion, and financial management in a simple and fun way.

Please stay tuned for our upcoming program by joining us today at https://www.svyep.com/join.
