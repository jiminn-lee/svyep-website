Growing up in India, Samarth Jain moved to the United States to pursue his undergraduate studies in Illinois. Following graduation, he worked on Wall Street for a while before returning to India in 2012 to start his own business focused on advanced cancer testing. His company, PositiveBioscience, aimed to bridge the gap in access to technology for cancer patients in India. Even for those who could afford it, testing to determine the next stage of cancer treatment was not easily accessible to patients in India. PositiveBioscience offered affordable and advanced testing that enabled quicker diagnoses and personalized treatment plans for cancer patients in India.

After his journey leading PositiveBioscience, Jain founded a new SBJain School of Global Management in the Bay Area, known as CALMU or California Miramar University. SBJain School of Global Management has campuses in Mumbai, Dubai, Singapore, Sydney, London, and now three in California. I had the opportunity to speak with Samarth Jain, a person who revolutionized the healthcare industry in India and is now working to educate the next generation.

After learning about Jain’s background and journey, I shifted our conversation to his current venture of founding CALMU.

**What steps did you take to establish CALMU’s location?**  
“Starting a project in the U.S. involves obtaining state approval and, if necessary, education approval for loan titles. International students also require approval from the Department of Homeland Security, adding another layer to the heavily regulated industry, comparable to banking and healthcare. Each country has its own regulations, so compliance with local laws is essential while maintaining an integrated system for innovation. For the physical location, from the start, we’ve been fortunate to work closely with the San Jose Mayor’s office, which has helped us navigate the process efficiently. We had to build classrooms and ensure compliance with city permits, including fire safety. When selecting the space, we prioritized proximity to housing and walkability to ensure students have easy access and activities. Our goal is to create a space that meets various needs where students will be happy to learn and engage.”

**How does this university differ from others in its mission or approach?**  
“If I had to pick two things, I would say firstly, our focus is really around getting our students job opportunities. 95% of our students are hired usually within three months after graduation because employers trust that we're doing a good job, selecting and training the students to succeed in that job and industry. Secondly, we recently launched more than 20 AI courses in the last year alone and we've also just rolled out an AI tutor we programmed ourselves. The AI tutor allows students to ask the tutor to clear up concepts they don’t understand and is available to students 24/7. We utilize the AI tool to help guide students on specific courses, accessing our own materials and resources instead of searching the internet. We really want our students to be fully aware of how to use AI technology so that they succeed out there in the world.”

**What impact do you hope the university will have on its students and the community?**  
“The impact of the university on its students and the community depends on the individual student and the career path they want to pursue. For example, I met a military student whose goal was to earn a degree to improve his chances for promotion within his company. Another student, originally from Egypt, completed his bachelor's and master’s degrees in computer information systems with us, but he exceeded his goals and landed a job at Apple. The university's courses are tailored to meet the diverse needs of students, with both required and optional courses that align with their interests and goals.”

**Do you have any advice for students pursuing a business degree and how they can prepare for future job opportunities?**  
“I’m hesitant to give general advice to all students, as each individual’s path is unique. However, I can share that skills like AI are becoming increasingly valuable. AI presents a great opportunity for students to set themselves apart by mastering AI and applying it to business cases and solutions. At our university, we’re working on incorporating AI into some projects, such as automating certain processes or improving efficiency, though we still rely on human oversight for things like admissions. We’re constantly exploring ways to improve with AI, like using it to review PowerPoint slides for errors. It's an evolving field, and staying adaptable will be key for future job opportunities. If students are able to adapt to our fast changing world and use newfound skills and technology, they have better opportunities to prepare themselves for future success.”

Samarth Jain’s impact extends beyond his success in revolutionizing cancer testing in India. He shifted his focus to helping the new generation in education by founding CALMU. The university’s commitment to preparing students for future jobs by integrating AI into their curriculum shows Jain’s dedication to creating accessible education that meets today’s fast changing world. Through his leadership, Jain continues to help others by educating future generations of students to ensure they are better prepared to face challenges in their professional careers.
