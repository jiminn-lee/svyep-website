## Event Overview

On September 28, 2025, more than 120 students, investors, and industry leaders gathered at Stanford University’s Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center for the Youth Business Venture Challenge. Co-hosted by SVYEP and Berkeley Summit House, the event brought together over 120 students, investors, and industry leaders for a day of live pitches, judging, and awards.

## A Global Showcase of Innovation

The event featured a diverse range of student-built ventures from around the world, showcasing innovative solutions in various fields. From gun-safety technology to AI-powered education platforms, these young entrepreneurs demonstrated exceptional creativity and problem-solving skills.

## Organized by Students, for Students

Organized by SVYEP and funded in partnership with Berkeley Summit House, the competition reflected months of planning and logistics organized entirely by SVYEP’s team of high school members. From coordinating judges and sponsors to managing timing, registration, and venue operations, the student team handled every detail leading up to the event’s success.

The vision behind the event was to showcase the professionalism and creative capacity of high school entrepreneurs. With global submissions, active investor involvement, and student-led coordination, the Youth Business Venture highlighted the remarkable capability of young founders when supported with the right platform.

They worked directly with Stanford administration to secure the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center, helped curate the judging panel, coordinated flights and schedules, and partnered with Berkeley Summit House to support prizes and event operations. Their dedication and hard work ensured the event ran smoothly from start to finish.

Submissions came in from around the world, and the top 15 teams were selected to pitch live in front of a judging panel of six industry leaders from companies including Microsoft, PayPal Ventures, and Amazon.

## Presentations and Judging

Each of the 15 teams delivered a 10-minute pitch, followed by a Q&A session with the judges. The presentations covered the fundamentals of early-stage venture design, including problem definition, target user identification, market size estimation, and business model outlining.

The competition opened with MarinaMed, a healthcare venture that set the tone for the rest of the day.

Throughout the day, teams took turns presenting their ideas, and during the networking breaks, students and guests stepped outside on the patio to engage with judges and connect with one another.  
"Watching students from different schools, countries, and backgrounds connect over their shared ambition was the best part," said SVYEP CEO and event co-host Bretton Lam.
