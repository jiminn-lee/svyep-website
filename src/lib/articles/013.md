The GenAI in the Valley 2024 conference, which took place on October 19, brought together about 700 people, including top professionals working with AI, autonomous driving, new energy, fashion, and investment industries. Three SVYEP officers were invited to attend.

The event featured a unique lineup of panels, keynote speakers, and networking opportunities. They talked about a range of topics, including large language models (LLM), and AI-generated content. They highlighted both the potential of AI, as well as the challenges, giving us a range of perspectives on the future. Something that stood out was the mix of technical insight, with real-world applications and predictions. The conference was dynamic and well-organized, it worked as both an educational platform, but also as a great opportunity to speak and listen to other attendees and professionals. I left the event not only learning more about the future of AI but also with lasting industry connections.
